# IT support ticking system
The ticket details entry page is designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and most importantly, responsive. The Create page is designed such that once the department name is chosen, it dynamically populates a list of employees. There is a text area for the user to describe the problem that requires assistance, titled “Description of Problem”. All fields are mandatory to ensure all necessary information is captured. The page also automatically logs the Date and Time when the request is submitted.<br /><br />
The ticket search page allows IT Support Team members to efficiently filter through the tickets. They can filter by "Project Name", "Department", "Received Date and Time", "Requestor's Name" or use specific key words to search within the “Description of Problem” field. The results are displayed in a well-structured grid with sorting options available for convenience. If no filters are applied, it displays all the tickets received.
<br /><br />
The application includes a page that showcases a visual representation of all projects along with a count of associated tickets. 
<br /><br />
The application supports bilingual interfaces, in English and French.
<br /><br />
The application has been built using .NET Framework, MVC5 and Entity Framework, with the front-end designed using Bootstrap and JQuery. The database interactions are handled using SQLServer. The application is developed primarily using C#, with CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactive elements.
<br /><br />
The type of SQL Server to use was not mentioned so local one was used as I was unable to set up a remote one in time but it can definately be done.
<br /><br />
The SQL DB Scripts and Queries can be found in the SQL Scripts folder.
